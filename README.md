# Image Classifier with Raspberry Pi

Handwritten digit recogniser with Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT used to demonstrate neural networks to school students in London.

* User draws a number on paper.
* Uses PiNoir Camera to take a picture of the number.
* The Raspberry Pi recognises this image and shows the user the number on the Sense HAT display.

## Future Work

* Extend model to one that can recognise and compute simple arithmetic expressions (5+2 etc).
